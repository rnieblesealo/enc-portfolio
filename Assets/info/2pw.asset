  title: Synthesis Matrix
  description: Once the maturity of one's research ideas gets to a point where a
    direction is resolute, the crucial phase of conducting secondary research begins.
    This second major task given to us in ENC1102 consisted in gathering diverse
    pieces of pertinent information from scholarly sources in order to begin building
    a central argument, which is meant to carry one's research thesis throughout
    further stages. This task required extensive analysis of other authors' arguments,
    with a special emphasis on connecting the information originating from such sources.
    All of the latter was done using a data table divided into several sections,
    each one with its own focus (Niebles, "Synthesis Matrix"). Exploring this information
    in such a way helped me make my own conclusions, thus helping me contribute knowledge.
    Additionally, the process of understanding the writing of others, which requires
    particular attention to credibility, led me to develop my information literacy
    skills.
