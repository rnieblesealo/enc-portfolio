  title: MA3 | Challenging and Exploring Conceptions
  description: The third major assignment finalizes students' re-familiarization
    with writing through getting them to reflect on their conceptions of writing
    after ENC 1101. This assignment allowed me to piece together my new conceptions
    of writing, solidifying my perception of my own writing process and its adaptation
    throughout the course.
