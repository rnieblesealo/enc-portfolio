  title: Review of Literature
  description: Our third major task in ENC1102 consisted in developing a review of
    literature using the secondarily-sourced information we collected in the previously
    showcased process work (the synthesis matrix). As it turns out, organizing a
    volume of information whose objective is sto constitute a serious academic article
    is not an easy task. Gathering appropriate ideas and laying them out in one's
    thought process in such a away that they make sense is much different from actually
    producing a piece of writing which coherently organizes these ideas in consideration
    of one's central argument. As such, I needed to branch out from my typical, rather
    rudimentary style of information organization, which mainly consisted in stating
    everythiing and explaining its meaning without any further action. For this process
    work, I needed to connect my ideas, changing the style of my writing and its
    organization in order to support my goals. As such, the review of literature
    was a fantastic exercise in multiple ways of writing.
