  title: Data Report & Survey
  description: Once one has enough appropriately organized secondary information
    with a strong connection to one's central argument, it becomes time to conduct
    primary research. As a researcher, I was surprised to see how much rigor one
    must abide by in order to conduct credible research. I found it especially surprising
    that we had to gain CITI certification in order to assert our credibility. However,
    it all helped me understand the workings of conducting primary research to the
    extent that I found myself comfortable in conducting my own without the compunction
    of putting out work whose credibility is potentially lacking. Using a survey
    with three distinct kids of questions (multiple choice, scale-based, and open
    response), which I chose by understanding the different kinds of primary research
    and their advantages, and refined by understanding what writing entails effective
    surveys, I was able to collect simple yet meaningful data from a pertinenet target
    audience and organize it in a comprehensive way using techniques such as coding
    in order to appropriately dispose it for analysis, which resulted to be particularly
    easy thanks to the rigor of my developed primary research techniques.
