  title: NWWK Quiz | Page 50 Response
  description: This quiz question regarding the ideas of writing challenges my ability
    to adapt my understanding to other cultures and contexts by reflecting on how
    writing is able to affect the writer, their identity, and their surroundings
    over time, and how these three processes are always present regardless of what
    the writer is actively producing.
