  title: NWWK Quiz | 1.0 Response
  description: This quiz question involving the rhetorical aspect of writing allowed
    me to reflect on the power a writer holds at the time of producing text by prompting
    me to reflect on how I have taken advantage of my writing's power in the past.
    It displays my newfound perception of writing as powerful and transcendental.
