  title: Initial Research Proposal
  description: 'It all begins with an idea. Our first task in ENC1102, developing
    a research proppsal, allowed me to truly understand how a viable research prompt
    really looks like when the latter is situated within the context of writing studies.
    Initially, my research question asked "how can the quality of mathematical education
    be improved such that students find it easier to engage and comprehend its content?"
    (Niebles, "Initial Research Project Proposal", 2). Although it initially sounded
    like an appropriate research question, it happened to be highly disconnected
    from the context of writing studies, given that it focused on the issues with
    mathematical education themselves rather than the conversation surrounding them,
    and also lacked a sufficiently specific scope.Therefore, after obtaining some
    much-needed feedback, the research question I ended up with was the following:
    "What arguments are the public making about the issues with mathematical education,
    and how are those constructed?" (Niebles, "Data Report", 6). This final question
    was more guided, clear, and relevant to my chosen topic of mathematical education.
    Understanding the flaws of this proposal helped me solidify my foundations in
    what is perhaps the most important aspect of research: Asking the right questions.'
