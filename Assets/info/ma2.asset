  title: MA2 | Writing Process Photo Essay
  description: The second major assignment continues students' reshaping of their
    conceptions of writing by prompting them to reflect upon their writing process.
    In doing this, I was personally able to construct a definite image of what my
    writing process looks like, and in doing so, was able to find aspects of it which
    I wish to reshape and reflect upon.
